# NoteCloud
Final Project for CS50x 2020

## What is NoteCloud?
NoteCloud is a website I have made as a final project for CS50x.

The website makes it easy to write and share notes with different users. 
Simply sign up and you're ready start writing and recieving.
Notes can be written on any of the site's main pages, and can be shared the moment they are created.
To share a note, write one or more usernames in the share-field, and they can now see what you have written.
It is also possible to divide the notes into ones you have written and those that have been shared with you.


## How to see it
The site isn't live on any servers (yet), so to view it follow the steps below:
1. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/adamjoer/NoteCloud.git` to copy the repository
2. Make sure you have all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file by installing them with your favourite package installer, for example `pip`
3. Run the command `flask run`
